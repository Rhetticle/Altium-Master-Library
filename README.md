# Altium Designer Master Libraries
PCB and schematic libraries for Altium designer containing schematic symbols and PCB footprints for components used in my other projects. I created these libraries for components I repeatedly use or cannot be found in manufacturer part search. I also found most non-passive components from manufacturer part search have ugly 3D models.
